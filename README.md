# devtraining-seed

Skeleton project for Genesis Application. This project has been created from the [Genesis Blank Application Seed](https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/blank-app-seed). Our seeds allow users to quickly bootstrap
their projects. Each seed adheres to strict Genesis best practices, and has passed numerous performance, compliance and accessibility checks. 

# Introduction

## Next Steps

Go to the [training](https://docs.genesis.global/secure/getting-started/developer-training/training-intro/) and start the theory and practice.

At any moment feel free to browse our [documentation website](https://docs.genesis.global/) to learn more.
